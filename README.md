# Practical types

## Introduction

### What
Small practical guide on statically-typed languages for developers who switching from dynamically-typed languages to statically-typed versions. For example from JavaScript to TypeScript or Flow.

### For who
This guide assumes at least some prior knowledge of dynamically-typed languages. The idea of this guide is to help make a mental shift from dynamic to static types.

Most of the time I will use JavaScript and TypeScript or Flow examples. Maybe this will be useful for other languages - I do not know yet, let's see.

If you have prior knowledge of statically typed languages, but Hindley-Milner doesn't ring a bell for you, this guide can be useful for you too.

### Why
This is my diary of personal discoveries. I find myself explaining those things again and again to different people. I decided to write it down once and for all.
